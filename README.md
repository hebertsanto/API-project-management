### API for project management

### description of the project

This is in principle a very challenging project as it involves many tables and many relationships,
developed from the beginning, starting with data modeling, soon after that it was time to choose the technologies,
I chose to develop with nestjs because it is robust and because I wanted to learn more about it, I used Postgres as the database.

### technologies used

- **Nest js** -framework basead on node js.
- **typescript** - by default nest already come with typescript.
- **Prisma** - orm for relationals database.
- **Postgres** - relational database.
- **Docker** - container to database
- **Husky** - for commit routine ex: before making a commit, run the tests or format the code.
- **Prettier** - to format the code and follow a pattern throughout the project
- **dbdiagram** - Use this software to model the data.
